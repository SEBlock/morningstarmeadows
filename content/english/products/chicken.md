All of our poultry free range in our pastures during the growing season by day and are locked up at night for their protection. 

We raise Rhode Island Red chickens, Bourbon Red turkeys, and Guinea fowl. In the winter they are given the opportunity to venture out of their snug houses and usually do so when the sun is shining and the temperature is above 0 degrees. They are fed non-GMO grains and supplement this with grass, insects and worms. 

We sell chicken eggs year round, guinea eggs from April to September and turkey eggs in May and June.
