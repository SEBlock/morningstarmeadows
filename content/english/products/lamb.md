#### To buy this much lamb is much more economical, yet it can require additional freezer space and it is a larger initial financial investment in your health. 
Remember that 40% of the fat in grass fed lamb comes from oleic acid, a monosaturated fat. Additionally, grass fed lamb is a very good source of selenium and zinc.

#### Prices:
- Half lamb - **$5.50**/pound hanging weight = approximately **$132**
- Whole lamb â€“ **$5**/pound hanging weight = approximately **$240**

#### What is hanging weight?
> Hanging weight is what an animal weighs after it is first processed by the butcher. This is generally 60% of the live weight of the animal. For example, if you choose to purchase a 80 pound lamb, the hanging weight of that animal will be approximately 48 pounds.

#### Does that mean I will be taking home 43 pounds of lamb?
Not exactly. There are still many bones on the carcass at this time that are not edible (the spine, for example) that need to be trimmed off. The weight of the meat you will take home (depending on what types of cuts you choose) will be about 30% less. So, using our previous example, if you are buying 48 pounds of lamb, you will end up putting about 30-35 pounds of lamb into your freezer. This will fit into about 1 - 2 cubic foot of freezer space.

#### Processing fees:
In addition to the cost of the meat (which is paid directly to Morning Star Meadows Family Farm before the meat is picked up from the butcher), the butcher also charges a fee and this is paid directly to the butcher when you pick up your meat. There is a $0.70 charge per pound hanging weight for cutting and vacuum sealing plus a $30 fee for processing for the meat. What types of cuts does this typically include?

- 8 leg steaks or 1 whole leg roast
- 2 packages spare ribs
- 4 loin chops or 1 loin roast
- 4 rack chops or 1 whole rack
- 2 package neck chops
- 2 shanks
- 6 1 pound packages ground

> Soup bones and organs will be included if requested
