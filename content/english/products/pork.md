#### To buy this much pork is much more economical, yet it can require additional freezer space and it is a larger initial financial investment in your health. 
Our heritage breed Tamworth pigs are allowed to roam in fields and woods. This breed is known for its meaty bacon and hams. They have access to portable pasture shelters, clean water and their diet of grasses is supplemented with non-GMO feed produced by a local farmer. Remember that pastured pork had deeper, richer and more complex flavor than factory-farmed pork. Eating lots of plants, rather than grain alone, increases the omega 3 content of their fat and the lard from our pigs is high in vitamin D since they run around and play in the sun all day long.

#### Prices:
- Half pig - $4.00/pound hanging weight
- Whole pig – $3.50/pound hanging weight

#### What is hanging weight?
> Hanging weight is what an animal weighs after it is first processed by the butcher. This is generally 72% of the live weight of the animal. For example, if you choose to purchase a 200 pound pig, the hanging weight of that animal will be approximately 140 pounds.

#### Does that mean I will be taking home 140 pounds of pork?
Not exactly. There are still many bones on the carcass at this time that are not edible (the spine, for example) that need to be trimmed off. The weight of the meat you will take home (depending on what types of cuts you choose) will be about 20% less. So, using our previous example, if you are buying 140 pounds of pork, you will end up putting 112 pounds of pork into your freezer. This will fit into about 6 cubic feet of freezer space.

#### Processing fees:
In addition to the cost of the meat (which is paid directly to Morning Star Meadows Family Farm before the meat is picked up from the butcher), the butcher also charges fees and these are paid directly to the butcher when you pick up your meat. There is a $55 harvest fee (for a whole pig – this is split if you buy less) and an additional $0.60/pound charge on the hanging weight for the meat to be vacuum sealed and flash frozen. Any smoking is an additional $0.75/pound. To further our earlier example, if you purchase a whole pig, you will need to pay the butcher $55 + $84 = $139 for their services. A half is approximately $61.10.

#### What types of cuts does this typically include?

24 pounds of pork chops
6 pounds of spare ribs
24 pounds of roasts or steaks
16 pounds of ground pork or sausage
30 pounds of hams
16 pounds of bacon

> Soup bones, organs, 4 hocks and fat will be included if requested.
