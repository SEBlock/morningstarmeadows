Our Bourbon Red turkeys are a heritage breed that naturally hatch and are raised by their parents on our lush pasture. They are humanely raised with no antibiotics or hormones and have daily access to grass and a stream that runs through our farm. They are only penned at night to keep them safe from predators. 

Our turkeys average 8-16 pounds each and are frozen.

- They are priced at $10/pound.
