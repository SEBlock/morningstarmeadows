Our Clun Forest sheep are a heritage breed that is in danger of extinction. For this reason we have chosen to breed them to increase their numbers (not to mention they are great foragers, easy lambers, phenomenal mothers and, in general, great sheep)! Our farm is registered with The Livestock Conservancy. We shear the sheep every spring just before lambing and lightly skirt all of our raw fleeces.

- We are selling the raw wool fleeces for $10/pound.
